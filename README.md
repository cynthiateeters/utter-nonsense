# Utter Nonsense

R was a rattlesnake,

Rolled up so tight,

Those who saw him ran quickly,

For fear he should bite.
 

r!


Rattlesnake bite!

With help from Edward Lear (1812-188) we make a page showing how to:

- Use [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) and its normalize to greatly increase styling speed
- Self-Host fonts with SASS
- Use Variable Fonts
- Build it all with Parcel v2

## How to use this repo

1. Clone the repo
2. In your terminal, run `npm install`
3. In your terminal, run the parcel watcher `npm run dev`

You are good to go! It will watch all your files for changes automatically and live update your browser.

When you want to stop the watcher, click in the terminal and press ctrl-c

## When you are ready to go to production

1. In your terminal, run `rpm run build`. The final version of your site will be in the `dist` folder.

## If you run into problems

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, which will include npm.

- Check out [Parcel's documentation](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html)

Thank you to [Variable Fonts for Web Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFqv5uVP_c&t=762s) for tutorial on variable fonts
